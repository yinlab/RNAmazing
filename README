CS51 Final Project: RNAmazing!


Running from the command line, execute:

	python master.py [.txt file] [visualization type] [prediction algorithm] [input format]
	
	-	The .txt file has DNA/RNA strands in one of the following formats (default, FASTA, or NUPACK)
		-	{strand_name;material;sequence}
		-	>name
			sequence
		-	name: sequence
	-	If the .txt file contains more than one sequence each sequence should be separated by a hard return
	-	Material can be either RNA or DNA
	-	Sequences of DNA can only consist of A, T, C, and G
	-	Sequence of RNA can only consist of A, U, C, and G
	-	The visualization type can either be circle, arc, mountain, or dot paren
	- 	The prediction algorithm can either be Zuker or Nussinov
	- 	Input format can either be default, NUPACK, or FASTA
	-	The case of text doesn't matter (i.e.  DNA == dna)

** See example .txt documents for the format of the .txt file
