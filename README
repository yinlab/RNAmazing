CS51 Final Project:  RNAmazing:


Running from the command line:

execute:
	python master.py [.txt file] [visualization type] [prediction algorithm] [input format]
	
where:
	-	the .txt file has DNA/RNA strands in the format {strand_name;material;sequence}
	-	if the .txt file contains more than one sequence each sequence should be separated by a hard return
	-	material can be either RNA or DNA
	-	sequences of DNA can only consist of A, T, C, and G
	-	sequence of RNA can only consist of A, U, C, and G
	-	the visualization type can either be circle, arc, mountain, or dot paren
	- 	the prediction algorithm can either be Zuker or Nussinov
	- 	input format can either be default or FASTA
	-	the case of text doesn't matter (i.e.  DNA == dna)

** see example.txt for the format of the .txt file
